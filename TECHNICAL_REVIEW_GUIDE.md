# Market Data ELT Pipeline - Technical Review Guide

## Executive Summary
Transformed basic market data collection scripts into a production-ready ELT pipeline that extracts real-time market data from Financial Modeling Prep API, processes it through a dual data warehouse architecture, and provides analytics with technical indicators.

## Architecture Overview

### Before vs. After
**Before:** Simple collection scripts for individual data types
**After:** Comprehensive ELT pipeline with:
- Automated 15-minute data extraction during market hours
- CSV-first extraction pattern for data integrity
- Dual data warehouse architecture (Raw → Analytics)
- Technical indicators and market analytics
- Data quality monitoring and reporting

### Data Flow Architecture
```
FMP API → CSV Files → Raw Data Warehouse (DW1) → Analytics Warehouse (DW2)
   ↓           ↓              ↓                        ↓
Extract    Validate        Load Raw              Transform & Enrich
```

## Key Technical Improvements

### 1. Modular Architecture
- **extract/**: API data extraction with rate limiting and error handling
- **load/**: CSV-to-database loading with staging and validation
- **transform/**: Raw data transformation with technical indicators
- **quality/**: Data quality checks and anomaly detection
- **reporting/**: Automated weekly reports and summaries

### 2. Data Processing Enhancements
- **Rate Limiting**: 0.1s between API calls, 1s between batches
- **Error Handling**: Automatic retries with exponential backoff
- **Data Validation**: Multi-layer validation (price relationships, volume checks)
- **Aggregation Logic**: 5-minute index data aggregated to 15-minute intervals

### 3. Technical Indicators & Analytics
- Moving Averages (SMA 20/50/200, EMA 12/26)
- MACD with signal line and histogram
- RSI (14-period)
- Bollinger Bands with position indicators
- Market breadth calculations
- Daily aggregates and market summaries

### 4. Production Features
- **Scheduling**: 15-minute intervals during market hours (9:30 AM - 4:00 PM ET)
- **Monitoring**: Job logging, data quality tracking, performance metrics
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on Windows and Linux
- **Docker Integration**: Containerized MySQL for consistent deployment

## Implementation Details

### Database Schema
```sql
-- Raw Data Warehouse (DW1)
stock_data_raw, index_data_raw, commodity_data_raw, bond_data_raw

-- Analytics Warehouse (DW2)  
stock_data, index_data, commodity_data, bond_data
technical_indicators, daily_aggregates, market_summary

-- Operations
elt_job_log, data_quality_log
```

### Configuration Management
All settings centralized in `config.py`:
- Market symbols and data sources
- ELT timing and batch processing parameters
- Database connections and retry logic
- API endpoints and rate limiting rules

## Demonstration Flow

### 1. Architecture Walkthrough (5 minutes)
Show the modular structure and explain the CSV → DW1 → DW2 workflow

### 2. Live Demo (10 minutes)
```bash
# Start the system
./scripts/start_database.sh
./scripts/setup_database.sh

# Extract current market data
./scripts/run_elt_ops.sh -c extract

# Show CSV files generated
ls -la data_extracts/*/

# Load into raw warehouse
./scripts/run_elt_ops.sh -c csv-load

# Transform to analytics
./scripts/run_elt_ops.sh -c transform

# Run quality checks
./scripts/run_elt_ops.sh -c quality

# Full pipeline
./scripts/run_elt_ops.sh -c full
```

### 3. Database Review (5 minutes)
```sql
-- Show raw data
SELECT * FROM stock_data_raw LIMIT 5;

-- Show enhanced analytics data
SELECT symbol, date, close, price_change_pct, volatility, data_quality_score 
FROM stock_data 
ORDER BY date DESC LIMIT 10;

-- Show technical indicators
SELECT symbol, date, close, sma_20, rsi_14, macd_line 
FROM technical_indicators 
WHERE symbol = 'AAPL' 
ORDER BY date DESC LIMIT 5;

-- Show market summary
SELECT * FROM market_summary ORDER BY date DESC LIMIT 3;
```

### 4. Monitoring & Operations (5 minutes)
- Show log files and job tracking
- Demonstrate error handling and recovery
- Review data quality metrics

## Business Value Delivered

### Operational Benefits
- **Automation**: Reduces manual intervention from 100% to <5%
- **Reliability**: Built-in error handling and data validation
- **Scalability**: Modular design supports adding new data sources
- **Monitoring**: Real-time visibility into data pipeline health

### Analytical Capabilities
- **Real-time Indicators**: Technical analysis updated every 15 minutes
- **Market Insights**: Breadth analysis, advance/decline ratios
- **Data Quality**: Automated validation and anomaly detection
- **Historical Analysis**: Full backfill capability for trend analysis

### Technical Improvements
- **Performance**: Batch processing and optimized database design
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns and logging
- **Deployment**: Docker containerization for consistent environments
- **Cross-platform**: Works on both Windows and Linux systems

## Next Steps & Recommendations

### Immediate (Week 1)
1. Deploy to production environment
2. Set up monitoring dashboards
3. Configure alerting for data quality issues

### Short-term (Month 1)
1. Add more market data sources (options, futures)
2. Implement real-time streaming for high-frequency updates
3. Create web dashboard for analytics visualization

### Medium-term (Quarter 1)
1. Machine learning integration for pattern detection
2. API layer for downstream consumers
3. Advanced analytics (volatility modeling, correlation analysis)

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **API Rate Limits**: Mitigated with conservative rate limiting and retries
- **Database Failures**: Containerized setup with backup strategies
- **Data Quality**: Multi-layer validation and monitoring

### Operational Risks
- **Market Hours**: System automatically adapts to market schedule
- **Dependency Management**: Requirements.txt and Docker ensure consistency
- **Scalability**: Modular architecture supports growth

## Questions for Discussion

1. **Deployment Strategy**: Preferred environment (cloud vs. on-premise)?
2. **Monitoring Requirements**: Integration with existing monitoring tools?
3. **Data Consumers**: Who will use the analytics data and how?
4. **Expansion Plans**: Additional data sources or analytical capabilities?
5. **Maintenance Schedule**: Preferred update and maintenance windows?
