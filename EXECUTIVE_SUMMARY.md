# Market Data ELT Pipeline - Executive Summary

## Project Overview
Developed a production-ready ELT (Extract, Load, Transform) pipeline that automates real-time market data collection and analysis for stocks, indexes, commodities, and bonds.

## Key Achievements

### ðŸ”„ **Automated Data Pipeline**
- **15-minute automated extraction** during market hours (9:30 AM - 4:00 PM ET)
- **Dual data warehouse architecture** for raw data integrity and analytics
- **Cross-platform compatibility** (Windows & Linux)

### ðŸ“Š **Enhanced Analytics**
- **Technical indicators**: Moving averages, MACD, RSI, Bollinger Bands
- **Market analytics**: Breadth analysis, advance/decline ratios
- **Data quality monitoring** with automated validation

### ðŸ›  **Production Features**
- **Error handling** with automatic retries
- **Rate limiting** to respect API constraints
- **Comprehensive logging** and job tracking
- **Docker containerization** for easy deployment

## Business Impact

## Next Meeting Discussion Points

1. **Deployment Environment**: Cloud vs. on-premise preference?
2. **Integration**: How does this fit with existing systems?
3. **Users**: Who will consume the analytics data?
4. **Expansion**: Additional data sources or markets?
5. **Timeline**: Implementation and rollout schedule?
